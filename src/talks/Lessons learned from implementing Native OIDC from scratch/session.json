  "Abstract": "Are we OIDC yet ? YES ! We are !\r\n\r\nOpenID Connect evolved as the one and only identity standard in the modern web. With MSC3861, the [matrix] ecosystem is finally moving to OIDC as the authentication standard amongst clients and homeservers.\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity, I started implementing a native OIDC implementation from scratch : no OAuth 2.0 library, no Ruma ; just the [matrix] Dart SDK, an HTTP client and the MSC in front of me. This talk will be about the lessons learned.",
