  "Abstract": "Can Matrix compete with Big Tech? That remains an open question - but the market conditions in Europe have never been more favorable to sovereign, European software solutions. So how do we build commercially sound companies based on Matrix? This talk will focus on real-world use cases, showcase features built for public-sector customers, explore viable business models, and share hard-earned lessons from bringing Matrix to market.",
