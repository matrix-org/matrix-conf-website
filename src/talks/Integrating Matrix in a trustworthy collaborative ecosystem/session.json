  "Abstract": "At Oodrive, our mission is to offer a secure and sovereign solution to manage our partners' most sensitive data.\r\nBuilding on this foundation, we are developing a secure collaboration platform that fully aligns with these values.\r\n \r\nCollaboration cannot happen without communication, therefore we decided to integrate a secure chat in our product. We chose the Matrix protocol to achieve that goal.\r\nNow that a first version is out and available to our partners, we want to share with the community how we integrated matrix in our product, and the challenges we overcame.\r\nNamely :\r\n - How we provision user accounts in our matrix instance.\r\n - How users authenticate transparently in the chat.\r\n - Make a demonstration to illustrate the seamless integration",
