  "Abstract": "NATO organised a TaskForce-X Baltics event where we very quickly contracted, deployed and integrated telemetry and video streams from uncrewed platforms. This required a lot of coordination and this was done through our on-prem Matrix capability. I would like to share my experience by using Matrix to support this very demanding operational project.",
