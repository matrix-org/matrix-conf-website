  "Abstract": "MLS and Matrix don't mix well. But why is that and what can we do about it?\r\n\r\nSince I got to touch that area a bit, I'll try to give some answers, but don't expect solutions.\r\n\r\nWe will be looking how MLS and Matrix work internally, how a tree is a DAG but a DAG not a tree and maybe we will have some glorious idea or get frustrated. No promises!",
