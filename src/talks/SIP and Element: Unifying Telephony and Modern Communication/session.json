  "Abstract": "Our project's main goal was to fill a gap by developing a telephony bridge that natively integrates XiVO enterprise telephony (based on SIP) within the alternative and open-source Matrix/Element ecosystem. Our focus with this bridge is to offer a credible and high-performing alternative to dominant proprietary solutions, such as Teams and its \"Telephony System\" licenses.",
