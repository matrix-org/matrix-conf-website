  "Abstract": "Most modern software applications give total trust to the service provider. End-to-end encrypted (E2EE) services are different: the service provider is a gateway, and the real trust is with other people.\r\n\r\nThis is unfamiliar, and can make using E2EE confusing. When you add in federation (meaning lots of different service providers) and a diverse set of client apps, trying to make Matrix's encryption understandable is tricky.\r\n\r\nIt would help to have a shared set of words and definitions. In this talk I describe MSC4161, which attempts to establish a shared vocabulary, and then my own thoughts about some metaphors we can use to make these ideas easier to grasp.",
