                    <p>We are asking you to wear a mask during your time at the Matrix Conferences. That includes talks,
                        the
                        booths, BoFs and sprints. Exceptions are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Outdoor spaces</li>
                        <li>Indoors while actively consuming food or beverages</li>
                        <li>Speakers while presenting</li>
                        <li>While necessary for communicating with someone who is hearing impaired when the ability to
                            see
                            the mouth is essential for communication</li>
                        <li>Very briefly to take photos</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Masks must be worn over the nose and mouth and must be made of a tight-knit, non-permeable
                        material.
                        N95, FFP2 or equivalent masks are recommended. Alternatives to face coverings such as face
                        shields,
                        loose gaiters, scarves, bandanas, and face coverings with ventilation are not permitted to be
                        used
                        as
                        masks.</p>

                    <h3>Vaccinations & Rapid tests are encouraged</h3>
                    <p>We encourage Matrix Conference attendees to stay up to date with the vaccinations that are
                        available
                        to them where they live. We also encourage attendees to use rapid tests (antigen tests) before
                        they
                        arrive and while they are at the Conference. The Foundation will not supply rapid tests on-site.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Easy Refunds</h3>
                    <p>We expect people to stay home if they may be contagious. If you are feeling sick or exhibiting
                        symptoms of COVID-19, or test positive for COVID-19, prior to the start of the conference, or on
                        any
                        day of the conference, please contact us at <a
                            href="mailto:conference@foundation.matrix.org">conference@foundation.matrix.org</a>. We will

                        type
                        for an online ticket or grant you a refund.</p>
                    <p>Onsite attendees will be able to watch talks online while they recover, wait for the results of a
                        Covid test or sort out any kind of unexpected allergy or “weird cold.”</p>

                    <h3>Dietary Restrictions</h3>
                    <p>All the food provided at the Matrix Conference will be vegan, which accommodates a wide range of
                        dietary restrictions. All foods will be labelled at the event. If you have food allergies,

                        stop at Fuldastraße. Take in to consideration that the line <span
                            class="public-transport public-transport-bus">M41</span> is often delayed due to traffic.
