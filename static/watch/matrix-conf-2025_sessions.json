Whether you want a more focused UI, a minimalist mobile mode, or something wildly experimental, Tammy gives you the tools to build it.",

When you add in federation (meaning lots of different service providers) and a diverse set of client apps, trying to make Matrix's encryption understandable is tricky.\r\n\r\nIt would help to have a shared set of words and definitions. In this talk I describe MSC4161, which attempts to establish a shared vocabulary, and then my own thoughts about some metaphors we can use to make these ideas easier to grasp.",

With the electronic patient record (ePA) and KIM for secure data and document exchange, Germany established a federated ecosystem using standards such as FHIR and OIDC with sectoral identity providers. The recent introduction of the TI-Messenger (TIM) extends this ecosystem to real-time communication \u2014 now connecting over 25 million insured citizens through the RISE TI-Messenger, directly integrated into their ePA app (ePA FdV).\r\nMatrix serves here not as the foundation of sovereignty, but as a loyal enabler within an existing sovereign architecture. Operating own Matrix instances (e.g. via the RISE Cloud) ensures data locality and governance under German regulatory control, while federation allows secure inter-institutional communication. This approach balances federated flexibility and controlled trust domains, distinguishing Germany\u2019s model from purely centralized or global platform solutions.\r\nThe talk discusses the integration of Matrix within the sovereign health stack \u2014 ePA, sIDP, KIM, TIM, and OIDC \u2014 and explores risks and resilience in large-scale federation. It illustrates how Germany\u2019s health communication layer evolves from document exchange to conversational care, preserving sovereignty while embracing interoperable, open technologies.",

    "Abstract": "Messaging platforms offer to protect user privacy via a variety of features, such as disappearing messages, password-protected chats, and end-to-end encryption (E2EE), which primarily protect message contents. Beyond such features, \"untraceable communication\" tools for instant messaging protect users from network attackers observing transport layer metadata, which can reveal who communicates with whom, when, and how often. However, unlike E2EE, the effectiveness of these tools depends on large anonymity sets, making widespread user adoption critical. This talk presents a research study with 189 users of messaging apps about their perceptions of \"untraceability\" as a concept, as well as their opinions on the widespread availability of tools for untraceability. The study explores their perceptions of  \"untraceability'' from a broad conceptual standpoint; rather than focusing on a particular tool or implementation, we analyze how users reason about what features should be incorporated by two fictitious messaging platforms, Texty and Chatty, to prevent third parties from \"knowing who communicates with whom\". The results point to a critical gap between how users and privacy experts understand untraceability, as well as tensions between users that see untraceability as a protection to individual privacy and users that see it as a threat to online safety and criminal accountability. Beyond untraceability, I discuss how this research is relevant to the design of messaging platforms that promote privacy as a central value.",

Today, several Swedish initiatives are exploring new paths forward.\r\n\r\nFirst, we will provide details on the latest developments within SAFOS, a service designed to establish a potential national standard for secure messaging, video conferencing, and real-time collaboration.\r\n\r\nSecond, we will share insights from eSam \u2014 a voluntary collaboration between public agencies \u2014 where a multi-agency task force is evaluating options for a common, open, and federated protocol for real-time communication. We will discuss our evaluation criteria, the challenges, and the potential of solutions such as Matrix to foster true interoperability, decentralization, and robust security for Sweden's public administration.\r\n\r\nJoin us to learn how F\u00f6rs\u00e4kringskassan and eSam are exploring ways to build a future-proof communication infrastructure based on openness and collaboration.",

Fragmented national systems are reaching their limits, while the need for interoperable, secure, and user-friendly digital spaces across borders continues to grow.\r\nThis talk explores how the open-source Matrix protocol has become a strategic foundation for secure messaging in healthcare \u2014 powering derived solutions like TI Messenger and CGM Messenger. Our approach highlights not only the technology itself but also the importance of collaboration with the open-source community, especially through our partnership with Element, to drive innovation, scalability, and trust.\r\nKey themes include deep integration into primary systems, the use of headless clients, and tackling challenges around usability, eID identity models, and technical complexity.\r\nWe argue that while Matrix alone is not the silver bullet for interoperability, it provides the missing bridge between siloed infrastructures and the vision of a unified European Health Space \u2014 rooted in open standards and coordinated implementation.",

Contextual Integrity views privacy not as keeping information secret, but as making sure information flows in ways that match people\u2019s expectations in a given context, or in other words, what feels appropriate to share, with whom, and for what purpose. For example, if Alice shares her live location with Bob through a messaging app, she likely expects the app to use her location only to deliver it to Bob. But if the app also uses her location to target ads, she may feel that her privacy was breached. The problem isn\u2019t that the location was shared, but that it was shared in a way that didn\u2019t match the context or her understanding of how the information would be used.\r\nI will explain the theoretical framework with examples of how it can be adapted to identify and explain privacy expectations of particular messaging features, and discuss how it can be applied to interoperable messaging to identify potential privacy concerns.",

The first signals are clear: structure lowers cognitive load and keeps decisions moving even when replies arrive \u201clate.\u201d We\u2019ll share what worked, what didn\u2019t, and how the same patterns translate to Earth during hospital IT outages.

How can we be sure that we are actually communicating with them? Since TLS can be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks by state actors, we can't rely on it entirely.\r\n- How can we trust the identities of users from external deployments that we don\u2019t control?\r\n- How can we limit the interactions that external users can have with users from our federation?\r\n\r\nWe spent a lot of time thinking about this and now have a plan that looks legit, and that we are currently implementing. I'm sure you want to know more about it, right?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will share the approach we\u2019ve taken to address these challenges and we will present the architecture we designed.",

However, access control in a Matrix room is decentralized: every participating server *independently* decides *who* is authorized to send and receive *which* events, without consulting any other server. To the surprise of many, these decisions are still *eventually* consistent even if all but one server is malicious, but seeing *why* requires a new way of thinking about access control. I will explain  the necessary design patterns from decentralized systems science, and show how they can be weaved together for a practical explanation of what Matrix is, and why Matrix can reach its astonishing levels of security and resilience.",

It\u2019s a case study of how we shaped a Matrix-based messenger to meet the strict security, interoperability, and governance requirements defined by the gematik specification, and how that shaped our development process in return. Unlike general-purpose Matrix clients, the TI-Messenger is deeply constrained by legal frameworks, security audits, and standardized certification making the path from concept to approval full of unique challenges.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll reflect on what we learned about applying Matrix in high-trust environments, what we would do differently, and how our experience could inform similar efforts elsewhere. Whether you\u2019re working in the public sector, healthcare, or simply curious how Matrix can scale to more regulated use cases, this talk offers an inside look at what it takes to make Matrix meet mission-critical standards.",
