title = "Introducing decentralised identity to Matrix"
track = "Matrix Internals"
summary = "Matrix is an open protocol for decentralised, secure communications. Its federation architecture is exemplary in supporting open standards, privacy protection, user choice and other aspects of system operations. Its digital identity system however is not fully decentralised and is a significant weakness in the overall user experience, authenticity and privacy protection. In this talk, Wenjing will share with the Matrix community an initiative to bring decentralised identity to Matrix and discuss both technical and user facing advantages of doing so. He will also dive into open source implementation options and seek community feedback and interests in such an initiative."

title = "Brain of the community: Matrix as a viable system"
track = "Matrix"
summary = "The talk is based on the speaker's research of the Matrix ecosystem a few years ago while studying at The Open University, applying the [Viable System Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_system_model) (VSM) to explore its organisational dynamics. I’ll start with a quick introduction to VSM, its origins and basic concepts; we’ll then review the current community structure, its evolution over the last few years, the implications from the VSM perspective and what the theory has to say about the future of Matrix."

title = "Standalone Matrix-based apps using the Widget API"
track = "Matrix"
summary = "Despite having a limited access to the Matrix API, Widgets have shown to be useful in situations where you need to host external applications within your Matrix client. Widgets have also shown that beyond-chat apps are possible using rooms as domain specific data containers, with custom extensible events and uploaded media. Still, they depend on an existing Matrix client that implements the Widget API.  In this talk we will provide an overview of the technology supporting Matrix Widgets, the tools and demos that exist, and present how we have implemented a standalone Widget client that allows us to have the NeoBoard Widget running outside of a traditional Matrix client context, as a full-blown Matrix-based application."

track = "Matrix"
summary = "Matrix is not only an open network for secure, decentralised communication. It also features extensions, called Widgets, for interacting with rooms. With the Widget API, you can implement your own applications based on Matrix. This workshop guides you to create your first own Matrix widget. Please read the description for requirements.  There will also be a dedicated talk about Matrix Widgets!"

title = "Stop calling Matrix APIs (directly)"
track = "Matrix"
summary = "Most people who have seen an introductory talk about Matrix very likely remember the famous it is this easy to send a message in Matrix slide, with a curl call to `/send`. It is factually correct but I dare say, spiritually wrong. You must not ever do this in your scripts or projects, and in this short talk I'm going to explain why. In fact, I will suggest a new slide that should replace the one with curl and `/send`."
