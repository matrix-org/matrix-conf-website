A design flaw in Matrix meant that this media was unauthenticated, and able to be downloaded by anyone. Fixing this requires a few moving pieces, cross-team dependencies, and a lot of spec work for the ecosystem to upgrade. This talk walks through the spec process to demonstrate its ability to facilitate large and small features going to production quickly, and covers the specifics of Authenticated Media ([MSC3916](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3916)) along the way."

It will solve most of the shortcomings of the current call system like: large encrypted group calls, ringing based on fundamental matrix primitives, resolving if two ppl call each other at the same time, reliable call connection setup, and extensibility. But it is also a bit more. It provides a fundamental signalling protocol to setup, store and participate in encrypted real time experiences in a distributed system."

track = "Matrix Internals"
summary = "Matrix is an open protocol for decentralised, secure communications. Its federation architecture is exemplary in supporting open standards, privacy protection, user choice and other aspects of system operations. Its digital identity system however is not fully decentralised and is a significant weakness in the overall user experience, authenticity and privacy protection. In this talk, Wenjing will share with the Matrix community an initiative to bring decentralised identity to Matrix and discuss both technical and user facing advantages of doing so. He will also dive into open source implementation options and seek community feedback and interests in such an initiative."

summary = "Despite having a limited access to the Matrix API, Widgets have shown to be useful in situations where you need to host external applications within your Matrix client. Widgets have also shown that beyond-chat apps are possible using rooms as domain specific data containers, with custom extensible events and uploaded media. Still, they depend on an existing Matrix client that implements the Widget API.  In this talk we will provide an overview of the technology supporting Matrix Widgets, the tools and demos that exist, and present how we have implemented a standalone Widget client that allows us to have the NeoBoard Widget running outside of a traditional Matrix client context, as a full-blown Matrix-based application."
