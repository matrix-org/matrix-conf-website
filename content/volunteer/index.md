To keep the ticket price accessible for everyone and provide the best experience as possible, we need volunteers to lend a hand!

We are looking for help in these areas:

- Installing the equipment before the conference
- Welcoming attendees, scanning tickets and handing badges during the event
- Introducing speakers on stage
- Handing out pre-ordered merch & selling merch
- Supporting the video recording team
- Helping people with accessibility needs navigate the conference
- Putting the equipment away after the conference

Volunteering for the Conference entitles you to a free ticket, and a limited edition zipper hoodie.
We will create a schedule to make sure volunteers can enjoy the conference, too.
The more people lend a hand, the less work each one has to do!

If you are interested, contact the Events Working Group at [#events-wg:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#events-wg:matrix.org) or email the conference organisers at [conference@foundation.matrix.org](mailto:conference@foundation.matrix.org?subject=Volunteering%20for%20the%20Conference)!
